# Datford
Java plain text data entry

# What is it?
This is a project that allows to you to enter CSV data in a plain text format. With multiple features such as a clear all button, choose file to write to, view file button and open file in the deafult system editor.

# Why did I make it?
I made this as an alternative to using excel for data entry, while excel is great I thought it would be great to be able to create something that works in a similar sense to that. It does not have nearly as many features as excel but it was great for learning some java libraries and other java concepts.

# What do I want to add?
I would want to turn this into a full fledged application. I think that if I took the features of excel and other applications it would allow me to have a great understanding of how these things may work in real applications. For example such as in an application text editor, and even additonal functions such as counting or finding an average. These would be great to add and acomplish in this program.
